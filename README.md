# UFOs
## Overview
### *Purpose of Project*
The purpose of this project is to provide Data of UFO Sightings using JavaScript as the primary coding language. The final output is a table that organizes UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array. The table has the ability to filter data based on date, city, state, country and shape. The filterable fields can be changed by the user to display the data that matches their specific search criteria.

## Results
The default table shows all available data.

Once a specific criteria is entered, the table will update to show results that only match that criteria. In this example, the shape of triangle is selected. The table is only showing results with triangle in the shape category.

## Summary
Although this is a useful way to display date, there are limitations. Information must be entered exactly as it is in the filters or it will not display a result. Dropdown menus are usually a better option in situations like this. That would give the user more support in searching available criteria. Additionally, there is no feedbck given if a selection returns no results, so that would be a great improvement as well.
